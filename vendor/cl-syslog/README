Common Lisp interface to Syslog via foreign-function calls.  Perhaps
one should add support for talking to it via UDP.

Example:

  * (require :cl-syslog)

  * (syslog:log "myprog" :local7 :info "this is the message")
  "this is the message"

  * (syslog:log "myprog" :local7 :info "this is the message" syslog:+log-pid+)
  "this is the message"

  * (syslog:log "myprog" :local7 :info "this is the message" (+ syslog:+log-pid+ 
                                                                syslog:+log-cons+))
  "this is the message"
 
Then look in your /var/log/messages or other location if you have
tweaked your /etc/syslog.conf.

Erik.
